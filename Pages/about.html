        <p>As such, when the Psychotherapist is emergent, intra-relational, feeling lead and attends to the here and now, the client benefits greatly from the cohesion between the Non ordinary experience and Psychotherapeutic approach, furthering both the depth of Non ordinary experience and breadth of integration.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">What is top down processing and what is Bottom up Processing?</h4>
        <p>To oversimplify, Top down processing sounds like “research suggests 8 glasses of water a day are important” bottom up processing sounds like “I feel thirsty, I am going to get a glass of water” The latter is the expression of an internally lived and organismic regulated truth, these kinds of truths match the phenomenological truths which emerge in Non ordinary states and is why bottom up processing is so important to support.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Who is this training for?</h4>
        <p>This training is for Mental Health practitioners interested in the field of PAP and well as practitioners who are already working in the field looking to develop their skills and orientation in PAP. Ground up module 1 is for any practitioner wanting to, or currently working in this field who is looking to further integrate their approach into an experience lead, felt lead approach to PAP. This training is also for mental health practitioners who may feel the training they have received is in some way limited or incomplete.</p>
