    <p>
      Module 1 supports therapists to guide clients deeply into their felt experience, both in Psychotherapy and Non-ordinary experiences, 
      as the pathway to deeper, more fundamental insights and subsequent change.<br><br>
      The scope of module 1 is primarily on the preparation and integration of clients engaging in Psychedelic medicines.<br><br>
      The macro learning outcome is the realigning of psychotherapeutic approach to match and support the characteristics of the psychedelic experience; 
      thus reorienting mental health practitioners from a top-down (thinking) orientation to a bottom-up (felt) orientation.<br><br>
      In bridging the triad of Therapist, Client and Medicine, the learner will navigate 2 key directions:
    </p>
     <div class="paragraph-1">
      <p>
        1. Learning and applying psychotherapeutic skills, approaches, frameworks, and lenses that support clients to engage via a bottom-up, feeling orientation 
        while staying in direct relationship with their own experience and the therapist.<br><br>
        2. To support the therapist themselves to become more felt-led, bottom-up, and in relationship with themselves and their clients.
      </p>
    </div>
     <div class="paragraph-2">
      <p>
        Aligning approach to medicine powerfully supports clients to better assimilate their non-ordinary experiences into integrated wholes at the cognitive, 
        somatic, relational, and spiritual levels.
      </p>
    </div>
     <div class="paragraph-3">
      <p>
        Being problem-focused, cognitive, analytical and “client-led” are important and useful approaches in conventional psychotherapy. 
        Although these largely top-down approaches are insufficient when guiding clients through many or most forms of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
      </p>
    </div>
     <div class="paragraph-4">
      <p>
        Learning outcomes relate to the macro phenomenological movements which psychedelic experiences induce.
